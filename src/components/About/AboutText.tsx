                Hi, this is Hugo ChunHo Lin,
                a 4th-year student at
                <a href="https://www.ncu.edu.tw/" className="code-highlight-yellow"> National Central University (NCU)</a>,
                driven by a <em><strong>genuine passion </strong></em>
                for the field of <strong>Software Engineering 💻</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently preparing my application for a Master's Degree,
                while simultaneously serving as a
                <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tw/education/awseducate/" className="code-highlight-yellow"> Amazon Web Services (AWS) Educate</a> Cloud Ambassador -- Tech Support </strong>
                and an <strong>Ex Software Engineering (SWE) Intern at <a href="https://www.pegatroncorp.com/" className="code-highlight-yellow">Pegatron</a></strong>,
                turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.
            </p>

            <p>
                As part of my preparation, I'm honing my programming skills using the <strong><code className="code-highlight-yellow">GO</code></strong> language for <strong>Web Development,</strong> focusing on <strong>API creation and backend tasks.</strong> Additionally, I'm delving into <strong>automated deployment processes</strong> to grasp fundamental concepts of <strong><code className="code-highlight-yellow">Kubernetes</code> and <code className="code-highlight-yellow">Cloud Dev.</code> workflows.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, I would like to demonstrate my enthusiastic <code className="code-highlight-yellow">Open-Source</code> spirit, as I am eager to share my new knowledge and what I have learned. Thank you all for being here.
            </p>
