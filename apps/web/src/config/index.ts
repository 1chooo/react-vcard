I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [National Central University üêøÔ∏è](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/), driven by a *sincere passion* for **Software Engineering üíª.**

My current research interests include ***Programming Language Theory, Operating Systems, and Compilers.*** To gain practical experience, I developed my own ***<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>*** interpreter using **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>** <sup>[[Code](https://github.com/1chooo/compiler-101)]</sup> and implemented [***Monkey Programming***](https://monkeylang.org/) Compiler with **<a href="https://go.dev/">GO</a>** <sup>[[Code](https://github.com/1chooo/monkey-prog-lang)]</sup>.

I will apply for Master's programs in Computer Science/Software Engineering for 2024-25 cycle. Here is my current [CV](/resume) <sup>[[Docs](/cv.pdf)]</sup> (October 2024).

In my spare time, I do workouts üí™üèª, street photography üì∏, and tech content writing ‚úçüèª.

**<code>Self-motivated, Team player, Love coding üë®üèª‚Äçüíª</code>**
